# King's Guard: Archer Defense

King's Guard: Archer Defense is a HTML5 action/tower defense hybrid video game.

This is just a concept for now. Design documents will follow.

### Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries

* HTML5/CSS markup is used as a shell for the game instance.
* <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> is used to create the client-side game code. The Dart code is compiled to JavaScript.
* The game framework used is <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>.
* Since we're developing in Dart, we must use the <a href="https://github.com/playif/play_phaser">play_phaser</a> Dart port of Phaser.

This game is a work in progress. Don't expect much anytime soon.
